## Downloading Data

1. Put your AOC session token in a file called `.env` in the formac
```bash
AOC_SESSION="<your_session_cookie>"
```
2. Download the data for a given day with `./download_day.sh <day>`

## Running solutions

To run a solution simply run
```bash
cargo run <day>
```
In order to run, for example, just part `a` of day 4 run
```bash
cargo run 4a
```

```bash
cargo run

This will run until an error is reached (e.g. no input data)
